# My Internship journey
In this repo, I aim to collect my work and the resources I used to apply to internships. I will also include the resources I used to prepare for the interviews. I hope this repo will be helpful to anyone who is looking to apply for internships in the future in the AI/ML area. 

I also hope to add some general information and tips and tricks that I found personally useful. Please be aware that this is just what works for me and might not work for everyone, so please take everything with a grain of Himalayan pink salt.

Note: at the moment, not every application I made is included in this repo. I will try to add them as soon as possible/when I am allowed to do so.
