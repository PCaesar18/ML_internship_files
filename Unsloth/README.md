# UNSLOTH internship application

## Introduction
This folder contains the code for the internship application at Unsloth. I have been a big fan of Daniels work through both Sydney Build Club and his amazing reddit posts (r/LocalLlaMA). I thought it would be fun to see how far I get through some of these questions, even just as a practice exercise (& definitely more interesting than grinding another set of Leetcode questions).
